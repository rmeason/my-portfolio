## About This Site

This is a site for my personal portfolio. Here you can view my sites and contact info.

### Built With

  -React.js
  -Zurb Foundation

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
